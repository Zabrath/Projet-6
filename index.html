				<h2>Designer d'espace</h2>
				<p>Je raconte votre histoire, je valorise vos idées. Je vous accompagne de la conception à la livraison finale du chantier.</p>
				<p>Chaque projet sera étudié en commun, de façon à mettre en valeur les volumes, les matières et les couleurs dans le respect de l’esprit des lieux et le choix adapté des matériaux. Le suivi du chantier sera assuré dans le souci du détail, le respect du planning et du budget.</p>
				<p>En cas de besoin, une équipe pluridisciplinaire peut-être constituée : architecte DPLG, décorateur(trice)</p>

					<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Bite my shiny metal ass. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
					<p><strong>Can I use the gun?</strong> <em> I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</em> And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
					<h2>You don't know how to do any of those.</h2>
					<p>No! The cat shelter's on to me. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</li><li>Who are you, my warranty?!</li><li>A sexy mistake.</li>

					<h3>Large bet on myself in round one.</h3>
					<p>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Bender, we're trying our best. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Bender, we're trying our best. We don't have a brig.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It's toe-tappingly tragic!</li><li>You're going to do his laundry?</li><li>You lived before you met me?!</li>

					<p>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
					<p>I love you, buddy! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
					<p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
					<p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
					<p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. No, just a regular mistake. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
					<p>Is that a cooking show? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Professor, make a woman out of me.</p>
					<p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>
					<input type="text">
					<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
					<p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. I'm a thing. File not found.</p>
					<p>No, I'm Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? I had more, but you go ahead. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
					<p>A sexy mistake. We're rescuing ya. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
